        <h2 id="troops">Troops</h2>
        <p>Troops are offensive units that are used to attack the <em>villages of other players</em>. 
            <br />However, they can also be found on defense in certain Buildings, such as the <em>Clan Castle</em> and <em>Guard Post</em>. 
            <br />There are a variety of different troops that can be trained, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Elixir Troops</h3>
            <p>Elixir troops are trained in the regular <strong>Barracks</strong>. Upgrading the Barracks can unlock more Elixir troops.<br />
                You can also research Elixir troops in the <strong>Laboratory</strong> to make them more powerful.</p>
